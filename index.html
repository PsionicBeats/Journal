					<h3>Why I Took This Class</h3>
					<p>I took this class to expand my knowledge in coding and use it in the future. Not to mention that poking behind the internet's curtains is pretty great.

					<h3>What I Want to Get Out of This Class</h3>
					<p>I, also, would like to code <span class="highlight">all</span> the things. In this venture, I am already enjoying all of the work that is being put into this class. Specifically, I'd like to put a background on this blog someday as well as a navigation so that all of these journals are organized by month.

					<h3>UX vs UI</h3>
					<p>UX stands for User Experience and UI stands for User Interface. UX is about the user and their experience using the site itself as opposed to UI which deals with the over all outlook of the site and how it is fashioned.
