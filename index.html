					<h3>Why I Took This Class</h3>
					<p>I took this class to expand my knowledge in coding and use it in the future. Not to mention that poking behind the internet's curtains is pretty great.
					</p>
					<h3>What I Want to Get Out of This Class</h3>
					<p>I, also, would like to code <span class="highlight">all</span> the things. In this venture, I am already enjoying all of the work that is being put into this class. Specifically, I'd like to put a background on this blog someday as well as a navigation so that all of these journals are organized by month.

					<h3>UX vs UI</h3>
					<p>UX stands for User Experience and UI stands for User Interface. UX is about the user and their experience using the site itself as opposed to UI which deals with the over all outlook of the site and how it is fashioned.

					<h3>CSS</h3>
					<p>
						Mr.Tan was not joking when he described CSS as black magic. Something mysteriously fixes another and I have no idea how. The fact being that it works, I could not be happier with the outcome. Clearly, I still have a lot to learn about CSS in terms of its inner workings. There are quite a few things that I would like to accomplish, like applying an image background for each article rather than having them separated by borders. While this process is incredibly frustrating, all will come in time. I look forward to finding my comfort zone with CSS. (Where ever that is...)

						 To start, I dished out all the work for html so that the structure would be there. However, going through the CSS portion was not as simple. This was one of the hardest works to deconstruct style wise, considering I had to toy with elements that I had not been properly introduced to until I looked them up on Google.
