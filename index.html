			<h3>Why I Took This Class</h3>
			<p>I took this class to expand my knowledge in coding and use it in the future. Not to mention that poking behind the internet's curtains is pretty great.</p>

			<h3>What I Want to Get Out of This Class</h3>
			<p>I, also, would like to code <b>all</b> the things. In this venture, I am already enjoying all of the work that is being put into this class. Specifically, I'd like to put a background on this blog someday as well as a navigation so that all of these journals are organized by month.</p>
